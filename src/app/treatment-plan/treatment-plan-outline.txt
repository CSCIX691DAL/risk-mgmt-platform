The treatment plan includes a list of tasks that are going to be executed in case a risk happened. so for a risk you define a treatment plan and that includes a
list of tasks. you call a set of treatment plans a policy. So a policy includes a list of treatment plans and each treatment plan related to risk and
includes a list of tasks. If it is not clear ask you question in the comment her and if it is clear close the issue.
- Treatment plan consists of:
list of tasks (per risk)

- Multiple treatment plans = a policy

Management or treatment options for risks expected to have positive outcome include:

    -starting or continuing an activity likely to create or maintain this positive outcome;
    -modifying the likelihood of the risk, to increase possible beneficial outcomes;
    -trying to manipulate possible consequences, to increase the expected gains;
    -sharing the risk with other parties that may contribute by providing additional resources which could increase the likelihood of the opportunity or the expected gains;
    -retaining the residual risk.

Management options for risks having negative outcomes look similar to those for risks with positive ones, although their interpretation and implications
are completely different. Such options or alternatives might be:
    -to avoid the risk by deciding to stop, postpone, cancel, divert or continue with an activity that may be the cause for that risk;
    -to modify the likelihood of the risk trying to reduce or eliminate the likelihood of the negative outcomes;
    -to try modifying the consequences in a way that will reduce losses;
    -to share the risk with other parties facing the same risk (insurance arrangements and organizational structures such as partnerships and joint ventures can be
    -used to spread responsibility and liability); (of course one should always keep in mind that if a risk is shared in whole or in part, the organization is acquiring a new risk, i.e. the risk that the organization to which the initial risk has been transferred may not manage this risk effectively.)
    -to retain the risk or its residual risks;

1. set up table using risk-profile.model from app/risk-profile
2. order risks by likelihood*impact, date, or whatever (display risks)
3. provide selection of treatment plan strategies for each risk (manage risks)
4. provide guidelines for execution of strategies?
5. allow reclassification of risk likelihood
6. allow reclassification of risk consequences
