            <p class="px-4 mb-4">
                Riski is a Risk Management web application currently being developed at Dalhousie University. During its two Semesters of development the platform has seen major changes, from initial project set up to connecting to and displaying information retrieved
                from its firestore database in a long list of unique front-end components.
            </p>

            <p class="px-5 mb-4">
                With the end in sight, future development of Riski will aim to increase the visual appeal of the platform while also increasing the efficiency of backend processes and maintaining reliability to ensure Riski users continue to have the best experience
                possible.
